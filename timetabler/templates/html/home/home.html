        <p class="lead">Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors measure changes in temperature and strain at discrete locations along a fibre optic cable. The FBGs are determined by generating periodic variations in the refractive index within the centre of an optical fibre. According to Bragg’s law, when a beam of light travels in the FBG sensor, the light from the broadband source passes through the grating at a particular wavelength, the Bragg wavelength is reflected which relates to the grating period. These changes in the wavelength of the reflected light are linearly proportional to changes in temperature and strain along the optical fibre and enables the computation of temperature and strain changes.</p>

        <p class="lead">There are six strain sensor arrays and two temperature sensor arrays. Each strain sensor array contains 16 sensors at 1.0 m spacing. Each temperature sensor array contains 4 sensors at 5.0m spacing. The strain sensor arrays were divided into two sets of three arrays each. These are referred to as set A and set B. Furthermore, there is one set of two temperature sensor arrays, referred to as set C.The position on plan of the fibre optic sensor arrays for strain and temperature can be seen in the adjacent schematic.</p>

        <p class="lead">When pedestrian traffic moves across the footbridge, there are various implications that relate to the changes in magnitude of the data received by the strain and temperature sensors. Such changes can result in fluctuations in various time-dependent structural parameters such as curvature, slope and deflection.</p>
